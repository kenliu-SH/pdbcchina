            - A composite electron density map typically used for the modeling
            of atomic coordinates from crystallographic data. It comprises the
            sum of a map of observed density (Fo) and a difference map of
            observed density minus density calculated from a model (Fo-Fc).
            During model building and refinement this map can usually show
            locations of incorrectly positioned atoms.

            correlations between atoms that lie either within a few bonds of
            each other (J coupling) or within a short distance of each other
            (NOE coupling). NMR resonances are then assigned to specific atoms
            in the molecule and couplings are assigned to pairs or groups of
            atoms. These couplings are then used to produce a list of restraints
            that specify that particular atoms in the final model be near each
            other. Finally, a computer program is used to produce a model of the
            molecule which fits all of the restraints.

            computed from the positions, intensities and phases of all of the
            reflections. A model of the molecule contained within the crystal is
            then built to fit the electron-density map.

            <b>diffraction (X-ray)</b> - When a macromolecular crystal is
            irradiated with an X-ray beam, the electrons surrounding each atom
            in the molecule bend, or diffract, the X-ray beam. As the beam exits
            the crystal, the scattered X-rays produce spots, or a diffraction
            pattern, on a photographic film or detector.

            the angle between the plane containing atoms A, B, and C and the
            plane containing atoms B, C, and D. Another way to measure it is to
            look down the bond between B and C and measure the angle between the

            of X-rays falls on a crystal. The scattered X-rays then produce
            spots, or a diffraction pattern, on a photographic film. In Laue
            diffraction, the X-rays are polychromatic and the crystal is
            stationary throughout the exposure. In monochromatic diffraction,
            the X-rays have a single X-ray wavelength and the crystal is rotated
            during the exposure.

            was expanded to include data items relevant to macromolecular

            experimental methods.This format overcomes limitations of the legacy

            - A measure reported for each atomic position determined by X-ray

            in the crystal, in which the atom is actually present in the
            position specified (model coordinates). If all molecules in a
            crystal have identical conformations, then occupancy for each atom
            is 1.00. If two or more conformations are observed for a small
            portion of the molecule in the crystal, the occupancy of the atoms
            making up that region may be less than 1.00. For example a part of
            an amino acid side chain may occupy two alternate positions so the
            occupancies may be reported as 0.5. The sum of reported occupancies
            of all distinct positions of an atom should add up to a maximum of

            <b>peptide bond</b> - A covalent bond linking the carboxyl (COOH)
            group C of one to the amino (NH2) group N of another amino acid.
            This amide bond is formed in a dehydration reaction, involving
            release of a water molecule where an OH is removed from the carboxyl
            group and an H is removed from the NH2 group. Peptide bonds linking
            a series of amino acids in form peptides and proteins.

            <b>pH </b> - This is an abbreviation for power/potential of hydrogen
            and is a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of a
            solution. Acidic solutions have a lower pH value (e.g., 0-6) while
            basic solutions have higher pH values (8-14). A neutral pH is ~7,
            while the pH of human blood is slightly basic (~7.4). Depending on
            the pH of the environment, amino acids and nucleotides may be gain
            or loose protons (i.e., get protonated or deprotonated) resulting in
            the building blocks becoming charged (+ive or -ive). The charges may
            interact with each other to form ionic bonds or with ions and other
            molecules. Protonation and deprotonation of biomolecular building
            blocks may be influenced by the dielectric constant of their
            immediate neighborhoods - e.g., the ability of an amino acid on the
            surface of a protein may be different compared to that of the same
            amino acid within a hydrophobic core. The PDB does not record pH
            values for individual amino acids or nucleotides. However the pH of
            the sample solution experiment, crystallization buffers etc. may be
            recorded and can be searched in the archive.

            of reflections that are not used in the refinement and is used for
            cross-validation. A round of refinement typically decreases R-work;
            if the refinement was successful, then R-free should also decrease,
            even though the corresponding subset of reflections was not

            always be greater than R-work, but the two statistics should be
            similar. If they differ significantly then that indicates the model
            may have been over-parameterized, so unreliable. Thus R-free is a

            is usually called the reciprocal space because of the inverse
            relationship between the real spacing in the object and the angle of
            diffraction. The further out you go in reciprocal space, the more
            the diffraction pattern becomes sensitive to objects that are in
            close proximity in "real space". This reflects the principal of
            Fourier transforms that linear scaling in one space corresponds to
            the inverse scaling in the other space. Short distances in real
            space become long distances in reciprocal space, and vice versa.

            <b>refinement (NMR)</b> - The process of improving the agreement
            between the molecular model and the experimental NMR data. Simulated
            annealing or some other molecular dynamics program is used to fold
            the initial model using simulated forces that impose correct bond
            lengths and angles, provide weak van der Waals repulsion, and
            satisfy the restraints derived from NMR. The resulting model is
            examined for problems such as van der Waals collisions, and for
            large deviations from conformational restraints. Models that have
            such problems are eliminated. The whole simulated folding process is
            repeated until a number of models (an ensemble) are identified that
            make chemical sense are are consistent with the NMR-derived
            restraints.

            <b>refinement (X-ray)</b> - The process of improving the agreement
            between the molecular model and the experimental diffraction data.
            Fitting models to the electron density map is an iterative process.
            The initial model contains phase and other errors, and certain
            measures are taken during the refinement process to correct these
            errors. For example, certain constraints and restraints may be
            imposed on the model during refinement. The success of refinement is
            indicated in part by a decreasing R-factor and the elimination of
            residues from unfavorable regions in the Ramachandran plot.
